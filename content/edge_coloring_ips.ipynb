    "\n",
    "Graph coloring is a very important and interesting problem in many domains, for instance computer science (image segmentation, clustering, data mining, etc.). Edge coloring, specifically, can be applied for networking and scheduling, for instance it can be used to scheduled round-robin tournaments as we will see later.\n",
    "### Learning goals\n",
    "This course will introduce you to an edge coloring theorem and its proof. Here are the learning goals of this class:\n",
    "* Be able to divide a problem in independent cases\n",
    "* Apply some cases of the proof to prove the theorem for general cases, for instance for any kind of graphs (Vizing's theorem).\n",
    "* Recognize the situation in a real-world problem and apply the theorem to solve it\n",

    "## 1. Pretest - Prior knowledge check\n",
